Lab 3: Implementing a Teams Chat Content Moderation Service  
Overview 
You  are  tasked  with  forming  a  Content  Moderation  Team  of  1  to  3  members.  Your  team  will 
develop a service that monitors Microsoft Teams chat messages for inappropriate content. The 
service must utilize Azure Logic Apps for orchestration, with the optional use of Azure Functions 
for  custom  processing  and  Azure  Cognitive  Services  for  Language  for  content  analysis.  Any 
detected policy violations must trigger an email notification to the designated administrator. 
Objectives 
1. Demonstrate proficiency in using Azure Logic Apps for service orchestration. 
2. Optionally  incorporate  Azure  Functions  and  Azure  Cognitive  Services  to  enhance  your 
service. 
3. Ensure real-time monitoring and handling of policy violations in Teams chat. 
4. Implement an automated notification system to alert administrators of violations. 
Team Formation 
Please  form  teams  of  1  to  3  students.  We  encourage  collaboration  and  peer-learning  through 
this  team  dynamic.  Once  formed,  please  designate  a  team  leader  to  coordinate  with  the 
instructor and submit the team list by Thursday, March 14, 2024. 
Tasks and Deliverables: 
Your Content Moderation Team will: 
1. Design a Content Moderation Workflow: 
• Create  a  flowchart  detailing  the  steps  of  your  moderation  service  using  Azure 
Logic Apps. 
2. Develop the Moderation Service: 
• Set  up  the  Azure  Logic  App  and  integrate  Microsoft  Teams  triggers  to  monitor 
chat messages. 
• Optionally, create Azure Functions to preprocess chat messages before analysis. 
• Optionally, utilize Azure Cognitive Services to analyze the content for 
inappropriate material. 
3. Implement Notification Logic: 
 
 • Configure the Logic App to send an email alert when a violation is detected. The 
content of the alert email should follow the template provided earlier. 
4. Test the Service: 
• Conduct  comprehensive  tests  to  ensure  accurate  detection  of  policy  violations 
and proper functioning of the email alert system. 
5. Document the Project: 
• Prepare  a  report  documenting  your  design  choices,  implementation  process, 
testing strategy, and any challenges faced. 
6. Present Your Solution (Optional): 
• Your  team  will  present  your  service  to  the  class,  demonstrating  its  functionality 
and answering any questions from your peers. 
 
Submission Requirements: 
• The list of team members and the designated team leader. 
• The flowchart of the content moderation workflow. 
• Access  to the configured  Azure  Logic  App  and  any  associated  Azure  Functions  or 
Cognitive Services configurations. 
• A written report, including a reflective analysis and any recommendations for 
improvements. 
 
Grading Criteria: 
Your assignment will be assessed on the following: 
• Accuracy: The correctness of the content monitoring logic and email alert system. 
• Complexity: The sophistication of your Logic App's workflow and the optional use of 
Azure Functions and Cognitive Services. 
• Reliability: The consistency and dependability of the service during testing. 
• Documentation: Clarity and thoroughness of your report.
